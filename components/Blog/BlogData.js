                    'Starting a new life overseas can be a mix of different feelings. If you are planning to visit Sweden or relocating to Sweden, then you should do a lot of research beforehand to adjust to this place easily. There are a few societal norms that are purely Swedish and Swedes are much concerned about them. One of the biggest differences you might see is that you have to keep your plastic bags with you, you have to take off your shoes while entering someone’s house, you have to squeeze out a lot of food items from tubes like toothpaste and much more.',
                    'Cultural and societal differences can lead to some problems for newbies in Sweden, but knowing these basic ones can help you to easily go through the process:'

They will call you by your first name be it your university or college professor, your doctor, your advisor or anyone, and they will expect the same from you during the conversation. That’s the basic standard in Sweden and regardless of the job title or position in the firm, people call each other by their first name. However, there are some exceptions to this rule as well. If you will be in a courtroom, or in front of any political figure, or meet someone from the Swedish royal family, then you have to be pretty careful about the titles.'

Falukorv’s origin can be traced back to the sixteenth century when Falu copper mines used horse and ox skin to make strong ropes to pullover the copper ores. At first, the meat was simply salted and smoked to make this dish. When the Germans came into the mines, then Swedes learn to make sausage out of meat. Now falukorv is made out of meat and pork by boiling it, frying it, roasting it in cream or grilling it. This is served with rice, mashed potatoes or macaroni depending upon your choice.'

These pancakes, however, cannot be cooked using new potatoes as these potatoes don’t contain enough starch to hold the pancake together. This dish is mostly cooked in winters so this is not an issue. The butterier and crispier the pancake is around the edges, the better it will be in taste. The trick to this is not to spread the batter too thinly. If you will add some diced onion in it, then it will be called “French” potato pancake.'
